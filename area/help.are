-1 POLICY~
#r* BUGS#n 
  Dont abuse bugs, report them, any abuse of bugs could end up with the
  deletion or denial of your character. Report them and you *MAY* be
  rewarded depending on the seriousness of the bug you report.

#r* NEWBIE KILLING#n
  Dont continually kill newbies, help them to learn the mud. If they
  train avatar advise them to train mortal. Do NOT kill them over and over
  forcing them to quit the mud, remember you were once a newbie, you know
  what its like. So this must stop now!

#r* SPAM KILLING#n
  SPAM KILLING is not allowed, if any imm sees a fatality message involving 1
  player and victim, more than 3 times the player will be denied. Torsoing is
  also not allowed, if this is seen the player doing the torsoing will be
  denied.

#r* MULTI-PLAYING#n
  Multiplaying is NOT allowed, you cannot have two players logged in at
  the same time, not for any matter at all. 

#r* CHAR SHARING#n 
  Char sharing is NOT allowed, you do it you stand a chance of getting the char
  denied for a period of time.

#r* BOTTING#n
  Our botting rules are as follows:
  You MAY bot your spell levels only, BUT EXP, QUEST, STANCE and WEAPON
  botting is NOT allowed. Punishment for botting is those stats set to
  0 depending on what you were botting.

#r* PLAYER ABUSE#n
  Personal and racial abuse of players is frowned upon, if anyone is
  abusive to you either racially or personally, please inform an imm
  immediately and a suitable punishment will be handed out to the player.

Please see 'help policy2' for further details
~

-1 POLICY2~
#r* ADVERTISMENT#n 
  You may not advertise other muds here, other places don't allow you to
  advertise so why should we. (Punishemnt - Silence for A time decided by
  the imm who silenced)

#r* ARTIFACTS#n 
  You may not hold more than 1 artifact at any one time. If you are found to
  have more than 1, an imm will make a choice of which one you will lose.
  Artifacts are NOT to be held on storage, or chars you play very little, if
  this is found to be the case the artifact will be redistributed.
  If you have an artifact and choose not to play for more than 1 week, you will
  lose the artifact and it will be redistributed. 

#r* LANGUAGE ON PUBLIC CHANNELS#n 
  Any form of swearing/cussing on public channels is NOT allowed. 

#r* RESPECT FOR IMMORTALS#n
  We are getting tired of people not listening to High Judges, Judges and 
  Enforcers (and for that matter ourselves (the IMPs) too), you continue to 
  disrespect them then you have no reason to play here and will be denied for 
  an undetermined time!.

  If an imm is playing a character on the mud please don't ask their
  character to fix the problem for you. Leave a note on the message board
  and we will fix it when we next see it. If an imm is on as a character it
  is probably because they want to play and don't want to be hassled!

  If An immortal tell you to do something you do it no questions asked.

  Respect the imms and we will respect you.

-1 HYBRID HYBRIDS~
.
We have the following hybrids:

Abomination = Vamp/Wolf
Lich = Vamp/Mage
BSD = Demon/Wolf
Baali = Demon/Vamp
Skindancer = Wolf/Mage
Nephandi = Demon/Mage

So the mud is not over run with hybrids, there are some
requirements, which you MUST (ie no exceptions) meet. They
are the following:

You must have a character which has 30k hp 15k mana 15k move, all
stances/weapons and full mythical or brass demonic equipment where it
applies, in one of the 5 regular classes. If you are a mage you will
need 20k hps 30k mana and 10k move, you will also need 240 in all spells and 
legenedary sphinxian. In addition to this, as we want you to know how 
to play at least part of your hybrid, the character that meets those reqs 
must be one of the classes that your hybrid has. e.g. If you want
an Abomination, your char must be either a vamp or wolf, if
a lich, then you must be a vamp or mage.

If you want a hybrid leader, and reach the reqs, then ask an imp to make you
one.

Once we have all the Hybrid leaders, acception or refusal is down to them.

0 CLAIM CALL GIFT LOCATE~
Syntax: claim <object>

By claiming an object (which costs 500 exp), that object becomes your 
personal property.  Using the 'locate' command you can find what items 
currently belong to you and where they are in the mud.  If you are not 
carrying the item, you can get it back by calling it with the 'call' 
command.  You can change the ownership of your own items by use of the 
'gift' command.
~



0 DECAPITATE~
Do this to another avatar when they are mortally wounded, and you will 
suck out some of their lifeforce (represented by 1000exp), making them 
mortal again.  You may also loot their corpse, of course, and if you are 
hungry you can even eat their head ;)
Decapitation alone is not enough to completely destroy another avatar 
however, for their head will retain their remaining lifeforce.  To truly 
kill them, you must crack open their head and eat (or in some other way 
destroy) their brain.
~



0 CRACK~
While holding a head in either your left or right hand, typing 'crack' 
will crack the head open, spilling the brains out onto the floor.
~



0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with you.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is half of your 
current amount, so it's a good idea not to hoard exp.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
~



0 ESCAPE~
This command allows you to transport to the temple of midgaard when 
mortally wounded.  Unfortunately, it also reduces both your mana and move 
to 0, and informs everyone else on the mud that you are lying defenseless 
at recall...so be careful how you use it.
~



0 MOUNT DISMOUNT~
Syntax: mount <creature>
Syntax: dismount

This allows the character to mount the specified creature.  Only 
creatures such as horses and the like may be mounted, and they will aid 
their rider in combat.

For information on the MOUNT spell, type 'help mountspell'.
~



0 QUESTS~
Quest Makers (and occasionally higher levels) can set quests for one or 
more players to participate in.  The rewards for such quests can be in 
the form of specially modified equipment.  A number of quest points-worth 
will be allocated depending on the difficulty of the quest, using the 
following guidelines for point costs (QP's = Quest Points):

Stats (Str/Dex/Int/Wis/Con): 20 QP's per +1, max allowed is +3 per stat.
Hp/Mana/Move: 5 QP per +1, max allowed is +25 on each.
Hitroll/Damroll: 30 QP's per +1, max allowed is +5 on each.
Ac: 10 QP's per -1, max allowed is -25.

Once a certain affect (str, hitroll, ac, etc) is selected, it cannot be 
chosen again for that item even if you didn't select the maximum allowed 
amount.  Choosing to have penalties on an item will not decrease its 
cost, although some Quest Makers may allow extra points if you select a 
few disadvantages on the item.

For more information, type 'quest'.
~



0 QUEST TOKEN~
Syntax: quest <field> <value>
Syntax: token <value>

QUEST will allow you to spend any quest points you might have.  For a 
list of the cost (in quest points), type 'quest'.

TOKEN will allow you to create a quest token, with the value of the token 
set to the value specified.  The tokens value must be within 1 and 50, 
and it cannot be greater than the number of quest points you currently 
have.

For information on the QUEST spell, type 'help questspell'.
~



0 QUESTCARD COMPLETE RECHARGE~
Syntax: complete card
Syntax: complete card <object>
Syntax: recharge card machine

A quest card requires 4 objects to complete.  To find out what 4 objects 
you need, type 'complete card'.  When you find these items, you should 
type 'complete card <object>'.  Once you have completed all 4 items on 
the card you will be told that you have completed the card.  Then you 
should go and find the dark crypt, where there is a machine, and type 
'recharge card machine'.  You will receive a quest token reward, which 
you should eat, and the card will be recharged with 4 new items to find.

HINT:  Vallandar's tomb can be found by going 2 south, 7 east, 2 north 
from recall.  Once you have found that area, you should look for the 
guardian and solve his riddle, enter the portal he creates, and you'll be 
in the dark crypt.
~



0 QUEST-TYPES~
The following are a few examples of quest types:
* Find the object/s.  Examples: Find 5 different coloured potions, Find a 
  pitch black longsword that flames brightly, Find a dragon dagger, belt 
  and bracer, etc.
* Kill the mob/s.  These can be hunt down and kill, or simple placing the 
  player in the same room as the mob/s.  Can also be combined with finding 
  objects - Example: Find and kill two different dragons and bring me 
  their claws.
* Solve a puzzle.  For example find a certain room, solve a riddle in an 
  area, or successfully get out of a maze.  These are particularly good 
  when several players of different ability are competing in the quest.
* Duel: A one-on-one fight pitting either a player against a mob, or 
  (more usually) a player against another player.  The conditions will be 
  decided beforehand, and can include any conditions that both sides 
  agree on.  Example: No sanctuary, no potions (or maybe a limited number),
  no spells, no weapons, or whatever.
* Skirmishes: Like a duel, but involves several players on either side.  
  Although the sides don't have to be equal in number, it is generally a 
  good idea to make sure they are roughly equal in power.
* There are also several more obscure quests that can be run - for 
  example you could require that the player brings you 3 small green 
  eggs, then load mob 30005 into the players room.  Another battle might 
  involve no melee - all combat must be with missile weapons.
~



0 EXPERIENCE XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.

You gain experience by being part of a group that kills someone/something.

You lose experience by dying or being decapitated.

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your alignment versus your opponent's alignment; how 
many of this monster have been killed lately (if they are an NPC); and 
some random variation.

See also help on 'status'.

0 STATUS~

The following are status levels for each class:

#w.....#b|#wOther#b         |#wVampire#b       |#wWerewolf#b      |#wMage#b          |#wDemon

Remember, if your status is above Avatar you gain nothing for decapitating
lower status ranked player (except a free loot, a head, and an enemy).
~



0 SKILL~
Syntax: skill | skill <player>

This shows the target player's skill with the weapon they are currently 
wielding and the stance they are in (if it's a specialised stance).

~



0 SPELL SPELLS~
Syntax: spells | spell <colour>

This shows your spell casting ability with the various types of magic.

1) Untrained.				 6) An adept.
2) An apprentice.			 7) A mage.
3) A student.				 8) A warlock.
4) A scholar.				 9) A master wizard.

slightly more skilled than another master wizard, and so on.
~



0 GODLESS~
By typing this, you will no longer be affected by most god commands, 
including restore, force, slay, mset, transfer, deny, freeze, etc.  You 
can toggle your godless flag on and off at will, and everyone in the mud 
is informed each time you do this.
~



0 HOME~
To set your recall point, enter the desired room and type 'home here'.  
From that point on you will recall to that point rather than the Temple 
of Midgaard (although you still go to the Templar Altar if you die).

A home cannot be a safe room.
~



0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  Your pet-buying opportunities do not 
accumulate; use them or lost them.  This policy prevents wholesale abuse 
of pets.
~



0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~



0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your magical ability increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your inventory.
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~

0 BACKSTAB BERSERK BS DISARM KICK PUNCH KILL~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: berserk
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: punch    <character>
Syntax: kill     <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

BERSERK will make you strike out at every creature in the room.  It will 
hit players as well as mobiles, so it's a good idea not to use this skill 
while you are grouped.
DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.
PUNCH will inflict a small amount of damage, and stun your opponent for a 
short period of time.  It also has a chance of breaking your opponents 
nose or jaw.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, KICK or PUNCH successfully, you must practice
the appropriate skill.
~

0 FASTDRAW~

FASTDRAW is automatic, if you have it.  If another player attacks you 
while you have any sheathed weapons, you will draw them out with 
lightning speed and strike your opponent before they are able to land any 
blows on you.  If you have any items in your hands at the time, you will 
throw them aside before drawing your weapons.

~

0 STANCE~
Syntax: combat <style>

In combat, the stance of the fighter plays a very important role; you 
can't just stand there and exchange blow for blow unless you are very 
confident of your ability.  Each fighting stance has advantages and 
disadvantages, the basic outline of which follows:
VIPER: A very fast and aggressive style of combat, concentrating on 
striking your opponent before they have the chance to avoid or block you.
CRANE: A wide, sweeping style of combat, which concentrates on a very 
strong blocking defence.
CRAB: A low, defensive fighting stance which uses agile footwork and 
rolling with attacks in order to reduce your injuries.
MONGOOSE: A light-footed stance, which relies on leaps and acrobatics to 
ensure that by the time your opponent makes their attack, you've moved 
out of the way.
BULL: A low aggressive stance which concentrates purely on physical power.

See also help on 'advancedstance' and 'stancetable'.
~

0 ADVANCEDSTANCE~
Syntax: combat <style>

Advanced stances can be learned after you have become a grand master in 
two normal stances.  These stances are much better than the others.
MANTIS: Requires CRANE and VIPER before it can be learned.  This stance 
combines a very strong defence with lightning fast counter attacks.
DRAGON: Requires BULL and CRAB before it can be learned.  This stance 
uses very powerful attacks, as well as protecting the fighter from injury.
TIGER: Requires BULL and VIPER before it can be learned.  Probably the 
most aggressive of all the stances, this style utilizes very powerful and
lightning fast attacks.
MONKEY: Requires CRANE and MONGOOSE before it can be learned.  The only 
affect of this stance is to completely nullify the advantages of your 
opponents stance.
SWALLOW: Requires MONGOOSE and CRAB before it can be learned.  This is 
the most defensive of all the stances, combining agile dodges with the 
ability to 'roll' with an attack, helping prevent injury.

0 STANCETABLE~

The following table is a rough comparison of stances, giving a value 
between 10 and -10, where the higher the number the better your chance of 
victory.  Cross-reference your stance from the left with your opponents 
stance from along the top.  Please remember these are only rough 
estimates, and may not be completely accurate...

0 FIGHT STYLE FIGHTSTYLE~
Syntax: fightstyle <number> <style>

This is used for unarmed combat, and it allows the fighter to decide on 
their style of unarmed attack.  Many different types of attack are 
possible, each with different advantages and disadvantages.  Your first 
attack in combat always uses the first number slot.  If you have a second 
attack, this will draw a fighting technique from slots 1 to 4.  If you 
have a third attack, it will draw a fighting technique from slots 5 to 
8.  Any other attacks are randomly drawn from any of slots 1 to 8.  If 
the slot is blank (0) then the attack is a standard unarmed attack.
~

0 HURL~
Syntax: hurl <name>
Syntax: hurl <name> <direction>

This ability allows you to hurl the target into walls, through exits, or 
through doors.  Hurling someone through an exit does a little damage.  
Hurling them into walls does twice as much, and hurling them through 
doors does three times as much.  If you don't specify a direction to hurl 
the target, it will be random (north, south, east or west).  You cannot 
hurl someone who is already injured.
~

0 SCAN SPY THROW~
Syntax: scan
Syntax: spy   <direction>
Syntax: throw <direction> <target>

SCAN allows you to see all the mobs/players within 1 room of you.

SPY allows you to see all the mobs/players within 3 rooms in a specified 
direction.

THROW allows you to hurl an object you are holding (in your right hand, 
or if that's empty left hand) to a target mob/player in a specified 
direction.  The object can be throw up to 3 rooms.  If it fails to reach 
the target by that time it will land on the floor.

For information on the SCAN spell, type 'help scanspell'.
~

0 FLEE RESCUE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 EXAMINE LOOK~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.
~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.

For info on the sleep spell, type: 'help sleepspell'.
~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.
~

0 NOTE BOARD~
Syntax:

board [number|name]                     Shows or changes board.
note                                    Reads next note.
note read [number]                      Reads a certain note.
note remove <number>                    Removes a note written by you.
note list [number]                      Shows up to number notes.
note write                              Posts a note.
note catchup                            Marks all notes in this board read.

Changing between the boards is accomplished using the BOARD command. BOARD
without any arguments gives you a list of all boards together with number of
unread message. To change, type BOARD <number> or BOARD <name of the board>.

To read next unread note, type NOTE. To read a note with a specified number,
type NOTE READ <number>. Typing NOTE while in a board with no unread notes
shifts you to the next board. Note that unlike the standard note system, a
note has the same number in NOTE LIST and NOTE READ.

Posting a message is as simple as writing NOTE WRITE. You will be moved
into interactive mode, where all you see are prompts for the fields like
To:, From: etc. You will be automatically put AFK while writing a note.

To see the list of the notes in the current board, type NOTE LIST. Typing
NOTE LIST <number> will list only <number> of the last notes in the area.

You can remove your own note by using NOTE REMOVE <number>.

Syntax: answer   <message>
Syntax: shout    <message>
Syntax: yell     <message>

These commands send messages through communication channels to other players.

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

AUCTION, CHAT, MUSIC, and QUESTION and ANSWER also send messages to all
interested players.  '.' is a synonym for CHAT.  The QUESTION and ANSWER
commands both use the same 'question' channel

You can use the CHANNELS command to hear, or not hear, any of these channels.

~

0 WEREWOLF WEREWOLVES~

At the beginning of things, Gaia - the world and the spirit that embodies 
it - set all things in a balance that would maintain and encourage life.  
Near the top of this chain of being was humanity, and above them were the 
Garou - the sacred warriors of the spirit.  They were appointed to be the 
crusaders against the Wyrm, who spreads its cancer through the humans.  
They are the preservers of the raw essence of life, of nature's diversity 
and purity.  They are the Earth's immune system, fighting the disease of 
the Wyrm.  They are the werewolves, and they fight and destroy the 
children of the Wyrm (such as the vampires) at every opportunity.

* Claw     - Transforms target into a werewolf, but costs 10000 exp. 
* Intro    - Informs everyone in the room of your werewolf lineage.
* Howl     - A special channel that only werewolves can understand.
* Tribe    - Shows information on other werewolves logged on.
* Gifts    - Shows a list of all the gifts you have available.
* WWpowers - Lists all the commands (NOT powers) available to you.

powers.  For more information, type 'help gifts'.
~

0 VAMPIRE VAMPIRES~

Vampires are the creatures of the night and thus take damage if exposed 
to daylight.  Vampires cannot eat food, or drink any liquids except for 
blood.  If they cannot drink blood for a long duration of time they will 
start taking damage or maybe even go berserk, so it's a good idea to store 
some blood in a drinking container.  Vampires take half damage from cold, 
none from gas, and double from fire, although those with the Heat 
immunity take normal fire damage rather than double.  Other abilities:

* Embrace - Allows you to feed from the willing or defenceless.
* Order - As if target lower generation vampire of your clan was charmed.
* Introduce - Informs everyone in the room of your vampire lineage.
* Vamptalk - A special vampire channel which distinguishes between clans.
* Regenerate - Vampire cannot regenerate naturally; they need to use this.
* Vclan - Shows information on the other members of a vampires clan.
* Feed - For feeding other vampires with your blood.
* Favour - Make a vampire a Prince, allow them to sire a childe, accepts 
  or inducts them into the clan, or outcasts them from the clan.
* Powers - Lists all the commands (NOT powers) available to you.

In addition, all vampires get 3 or more disciplines, each of which grant 
one or more extra powers.  For more information type 'help disciplines'.
~

0 MAGE MAGES~

Mages are those who study the greatest of magicks.  Their spells are far 
greater than those of a non-mage, as well as far more flexible.  Some of 
the main features of mages are as follows:

* Extra spells - Extra spells unavailable to non-mages, including spells 
  such as 'find familiar', 'polymorph', 'major creation', etc.
* Rune spells - Combinations of runes allow the mage to construct new spells.
* Advanced spells - Available to the more powerful of mages, this ability 
  allows the mage to create their own spells from scratch.  Such a task is 
  very difficult as well as time consuming, however.
* Introduce - Allows the mage to list his/her master, master's master, etc.
* Teach - Allows the mage to make an apprentice.
~

0 DEMON DEMONS CHAMPION CHAMPIONS~

These fiends are the damned ones.  They have sold their souls in exchange 
for power, and they improve this power by draining the souls of their 
victims.  Their powers are mysterious, but the following facts are known:

* Each Champion, Demon, or Demon Prince follows a specific Demon Lord.  
  They are able to channel the souls of their victims to their Demon Lord, 
  who in turn can use that power to grant favours to his/her followers.
* Demonic armour improves the combat ability of the wearer, the more 
  armour worn the better the improvement.
* Many demons are able to transport themselves to each other at will.
* Most demons are able to assume the form of a weapon.
* The demons power over death is such that even after they have been 
  decapitated, they are still able to employ a selection of powers.
* The powers of a specific demon vary considerably.  Some are barely more 
  powerful than a common avatar, while others are as strong as the greatest 
  of werewolves or vampires.
* While in hell, a demon is virtually unkillable.
~

0 BEAST~

Vampires, like mortals, are creatures of instinct.  However, the 
instincts of the vampire are those of a hunter, not a gatherer.  Vampires 
are the ultimate predators and stand at the apex of the food chain.  
They are highly developed killing machines - the harbringers of death.
For vampires to survive in modern society, however, they must learn to 
keep the Beast in check.  The instincts of violence (the Beast) so 
essential in the wild serve only to endanger the vampire in today's 
complex world.  The Beast's rage has its uses, but the blindness it 
creates far outweighs its benefits.
Vampires struggle to suppress the Beast, but, no matter how hard they 
try, they do not always prevail, and when it gets loose, the havoc it 
creates goes far beyond the horror of any mortal rage.
~

0 FAVOUR SIRE PRINCE~
Syntax: favour <target> <sire/prince>

Favour is an ability available to second generation vampires and vampire 
princes.

SIRE allows the target vampire of your clan to sire another vampire.  
Once a single vampire has been created the power is lost, but can be 
granted again if the Antediluvian or Prince so desire.  A childe sired 
without permission is known as an Anarch.

PRINCE turns the target vampire into a prince, who is then able to allow 
other vampires the ability to sire more vampires still.  Only an 
Antediluvian has the power to make some a prince (or to remove the 
prince's powers).

INDUCT and OUTCAST will accept a Caitiff into the clan or outcast an
existing member.
~

0 GIFT GIFTS~

addition to these basic three, vampires may learn additional disciplines 
from other vampires.  Only the single clan discipline is passed on to later

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere, although there is an experience
penalty for quitting outside of Midgaard.  When you re-enter the game you will
be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~

the Temple of Midgaard.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.

Once the proud and noble tribe the White Howlers; now cursed by all of
gaia. This tribe held dominance in the frozen highlands of scotland, now
they hunt in the night, cloaked in corruption and insanity and guided only
by the taint in their blood. Each member begins its decent into madness by
travelling through the black spiral, a maze of chaos and insanity located
within the deep umbra in the twisted city of Malfeus and from there, the
abominations mimic their corruped caerns and hives benath the earth,
infesting gaia and attacking her protectors and slaughtering the innocent,
this is their way, and they know only chaos.

0 NEPHANDI~

With insanity comes power and the ability to alter reality, so belive the
nephandi, dark servants of creatures beyond reality and sanity. Mages who
consort with beings calling themselves anything and nothing, for their own
imagination is the only limit to the madness, these are the Nephandi. They
draw their power from reality but twist and break its rules without fear
of paradox as their perception of reality is strong enough to overrule the
guardians of the universe, at least at a small level,....within the deep
umbra where they form their elaborate chantries their power if infinite,
for with no forces to opose their will, reality is theirs to shape,
control and destroy as they please.

Mud Client Compression Protocol

Basicly it compresses the information transfered between
the mud server and the mud client. freeing up bandwidth and
making things a bit smoother for everyone.

Zmud users we encurage you to get a copy of mcclient from
the projects site http://www.randomly.org/

This was ported by Morglum with thanks to Marlow to help you
better enjoy your mudding experience here. and he would like
to give his thanks to the forerunner's in the mccp development,
zlib and thanks Abandoned Reality for there efforts.

see 'help mcclient' for more information on the linux/win32

0 MCCLIENT~
mcclient performs decompression of the mud client compression
protocol This protocol allows the mud to compress all data it
sends to you. This reduces the bandwidth used by the mud
(and bandwidth costs money).
It also tends to speed up your mud connection somewhat - less
data is sent, so packet loss is less likely, and large output
can actually get there faster.

It works by accepting connections on YOUR machine, and
redirecting them to the mud. The connection to the mud is
compressed, but the local connection is not - so you can use
whatever client you normally use without any modifications
being needed.

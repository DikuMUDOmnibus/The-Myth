shape line wire mote motes blade~
a wire~

the air before you.

shape white featureless pentagon~
a pentagon~
A pentagon glides through the air.
~
If you watch closely, you can see that the forward edge has a little flame
along it. You feel glad it's only slicing up molecules, not atoms.

shape white featureless hexagon~
a hexagon~
A hexagon drifts, forcing the other shapes to flee before it.
~
The hexagon is the sharpest thing even this universe has to offer. Indeed, any
universe; for this hexagon is so sharp, black rifts are left in it's wake,
cuts in Reality.

Around you stretches a white featureless plain. Something is not right though;
space seems even more twisted than normal in this place. You get the feeling

Sphere~
Everything is white. No matter how you spin about, you can't find an edge or
